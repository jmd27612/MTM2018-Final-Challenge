# MTM2018-Final-Challenge
My submission for the Master the Mainframe 2018 final challenge. 

The final challenge is very different from the previous action based challenges with specific instructional guidance. The final challenge is the opportunity to explore the environment and think about what you would present to demonstrate your expanding z/OS technical ability. Have fun and work on the final challenge as time permits. You have months to complete the challenge.
