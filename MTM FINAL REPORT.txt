JES2
 JOB ENTRY SUBSYSTEM
     THE JOB ENTRY SUBSYSTEM MANAGES BATCH WORKLOADS. THERE ARE
     DISTINCT PHASES OF EXECUTION FOR EACH JOB: INPUT, EXECUTION,
     AND OUTPUT.

MSTR
 MASTER SCHEDULER SUBSYSTEM
     THE MASTER SUBSYSTEM STARTS JOBS THAT RUN OUTSIDE OF THE
     JES SUBSYSTEM, INCLUDING JES ITSELF.

IZUG
 Z/OSMF MESSAGE SERVICE
     Z/OSMF (IBM Z/OS MANAGEMENT FACILITY) RECORDS MESSAGES FROM
     THE PRODUCT INTERFACE, FROM TASKS PERFORMED BY Z/OSMF USERS,
     AND FROM PROGRAMS RUNNING ON THE Z/OS HOST SYSTEM.

SMS
 STORAGE MANAGEMENT SUBSYSTEM
     THE STORAGE MANAGEMENT SUBSYSTEM IS A COMPONENT OF DFSMS
     WHICH DETERMINES DATA PLACEMENT AND HANDLES DATA BACKUP,
     MOVEMENT, SPACE, AND SECURITY. THIS REDUCES THE NEED FOR
     MANY STORAGE ADMINISTRATORS ON A SINGLE SYSTEM/SYSPLEX.

RACF
 RESOURCE ACCESS CONTROL FACILITY - Z/OS SECURITY SERVER
     RACF IS A COMPONENT OF Z/OS SECURITY SERVER WHICH HANDLES
     IDENTIFYING/VERIFYING USERS, AUTHORIZING USERS TO ACCESS
     PROTECTED RESOURCES, AND RECORDING/REPORTING ACCESS ATTEMPS.
